        // data        - A pointer to the buffer of data to write.
        // dataLength  - The amount, in bytes, of data to write.
        // processed   - On return, the length, in bytes, of the data actually written.
        //
        // It sounds pretty straight-forward,
        // but there are a few caveats you should be aware of.
        //
        // The SSLWrite method operates in a non-obvious (and rather annoying) manner.
        // According to the documentation:
        //
        //   Because you may configure the underlying connection to operate in a non-blocking manner,
        //   a write operation might return errSSLWouldBlock, indicating that less data than requested
        //   was actually transferred. In this case, you should repeat the call to SSLWrite until some
        //   other result is returned.
        //
        // This sounds perfect, but when our SSLWriteFunction returns errSSLWouldBlock,
        // then the SSLWrite method returns (with the proper errSSLWouldBlock return value),
        // but it sets processed to dataLength !!
        //
        // In other words, if the SSLWrite function doesn't completely write all the data we tell it to,
        // then it doesn't tell us how many bytes were actually written. So, for example, if we tell it to
        // write 256 bytes then it might actually write 128 bytes, but then report 0 bytes written.
        //
        // You might be wondering:
        // If the SSLWrite function doesn't tell us how many bytes were written,
        // then how in the world are we supposed to update our parameters (buffer & bytesToWrite)
        // for the next time we invoke SSLWrite?
        //
        // The answer is that SSLWrite cached all the data we told it to write,
        // and it will push out that data next time we call SSLWrite.
        // If we call SSLWrite with new data, it will push out the cached data first, and then the new data.
        // If we call SSLWrite with empty data, then it will simply push out the cached data.
        //
        // For this purpose we're going to break large writes into a series of smaller writes.
        // This allows us to report progress back to the delegate.
