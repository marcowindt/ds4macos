/// This struct can help you to filter send data
/// A filter can provide several interesting possibilities:
///
/// 1. Optional caching of resolved addresses for domain names.
///    The cache could later be consulted, resulting in fewer system calls to getaddrinfo.
///
/// 2. Reusable modules of code for bandwidth monitoring.
///
/// 3. Sometimes traffic shapers are needed to simulate real world environments.
///    A filter allows you to write custom code to simulate such environments.
///    The ability to code this yourself is especially helpful when your simulated environment
///    is more complicated than simple traffic shaping (e.g. simulating a cone port restricted router),
///    or the system tools to handle this aren't available (e.g. on a mobile device).

    ///   - $0: true if the received packet should be passed onto the delegate.
    ///         false if the received packet should be discarded, and not reported to the delegete.
